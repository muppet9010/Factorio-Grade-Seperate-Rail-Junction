# Factorio-Railway-Tunnel

ALPHA MOD - Early release mod and versions won't upgrade. Use for testing/experimenting only.
==============================

Mod Features
===========

- Trains will natively use tunnels just like any other track, no need to specially path via them. You can have a train stop part way in/out of a tunnel at a signal or station.
- The tunnel is a single block of rail and so only 1 train can use a tunnel at a time. Trains do prefer empty normal tracks over tunnels, but will use a tunnel over congested track.
- Tunnels are built by placing the entrance and exit pieces and then building underground tunnel between them. Special pieces of underground tunnel allow for rail tracks on the surface to cross the tunnel.


Usage Notes
===============

- The train signal reservation for leaving a tunnel may be sub optimal and so it's advised to have some track and a signal block for the train to emerge in to. The train may also pull up to a blocking signal slowly when leaving a tunnel.
- Trains using a tunnel will never be exactly aligned for the entering and leaving parts, but will be very close.This is a technical limitation of how the mod syncs train speeds each tick and isn't a bug.
