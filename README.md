# Factorio-Railway-Tunnel
A railway tunnel so trains can cross under each other.

ALPHA MOD - Early release mod and versions won't upgrade. Use for testing/experimenting only.


Usage Notes
===============

-The train signal reservation for leaving a tunnel will be sub optimal and so it's advised to have some track and a signal block for the train to emerge in to. Maybe length of train is a good size?
