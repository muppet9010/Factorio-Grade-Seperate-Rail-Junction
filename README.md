# Factorio-Railway-Tunnel
A railway tunnel so trains can cross under each other.

ALPHA MOD - Early release mod and versions won't upgrade. Use for testing/experimenting only.


Usage Notes
===============

- The train signal reservation for leaving a tunnel may be sub optimal and so it's advised to have some track and a signal block for the train to emerge in to. The train may also pull up to a blocking signal slowly when leaving a tunnel.
- Trains using a tunnel will never be exactly aligned for the entering and leaving parts. They shouldn;t be more than a tile of one another and is a technical limitation of how the mod syncs speeds each tick.
