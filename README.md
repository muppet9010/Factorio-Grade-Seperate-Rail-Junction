# Factorio-Railway-Tunnel

ALPHA MOD
=========

Early release mod and future versions won't allow upgrading. Use for testing/experimenting only.
For applying a new mod version to your game you will need to do the below manual upgrade process. I'd advise the save games are done as separate so you can rollback if needed:
    - Empty all your tunnels and save the game (save 1). Take safety blueprint copies of any tunnel/track designs you wish as they will be removed in the next stage.
    - Remove the old mod version and load the save (save 1). This will purge your map and game state of old mod entities and data. Save the game again (save 2).
    - Put the new mod in place and load the save (save 2). Your game is now on the new mod version and the tunnel's can be re-added.


Mod Features
============

- Trains will natively use tunnels just like any other track, no need to specially path via them.
- Tunnels are built by placing the entrance and exit tunnel portal parts and building underground tunnel parts between them. Special pieces of underground tunnel allow for rail tracks on the surface to cross the tunnel.
- Tunnels can not be entered by players, they are purely for trains to go under one another. Players riding in trains through tunnels stay on the surface to enjoy the view.
- Tunnels are composed of 2 complete portals with underground parts connecting them. Which comprise multiple parts for maximum design flexibility:
    - A complete portal is made of 2 portal End parts with a number of portal Segments between them. Each portal's segmentâ€™s length (end parts not counted) must be long enough for the train when it tries to use the tunnel.
        - When a complete portal is made a tunnel portal graphic will appear with both ends of the portal closed to trains.
    - The underground of the tunnel is made up of a series of underground parts.
    - When 2 valid portals are connected by underground parts a tunnel is formed. This can be seen as the outside ends of each portal facing the wider rail network will have their graphics show an opening, with rail and signals appearing on them. At this point trains can path through the tunnel and use it.
- A train must fully fit within the tunnel's entrance and exit portal to be able to use the tunnel. If the train is too long it will be prevented access and a GUI alert raised to the player. Unfortunately I can't stop the train trying to path through the tunnel so some consideration by the player when building their rail network is required. The max length train a tunnel can accept is the minimum length of either portal's segments (non end parts). A train's length for vanilla Factorio carriages is 6 tiles, plus 1 tile per carriage connection. This will match the length of a train on a regular track. i.e. 1 carriage is 6 tiles, 2 carriages are 13 tiles (6+1+6).
- The mod has been designed and optimised to be UPS efficient.
- Tunnels can be used in both directions, however, the mod is designed on the basis that most tunnels will be either used in a single direction as part of dual tracks or bi-directional on a very low usage rail track. There is a documented limitation around a rare issue with high frequency bi-diretional tunnel usage later in this readme.
- Tunnel/Portal GUI shown when a portal part is clicked on. Shows key information about it including the size of train it supports and the current usage state. It has features to help the player handle any odd situations, with options to distribute fuel to the train using the tunnel, and an option to mine all train carriages on the tunnel portal's tracks.


Usage Notes
===========

- The tunnel parts can only be validly placed on the rail grid, however, it isn't possible to snap these like a regular rail track. So if the tunnel part is misplaced the nearby rail grid locations will be highlighted, a green square for buildable locations and a red square for blocked locations, based on ghost type placement.
- The tunnel is a single block of rail and so only 1 train can use a tunnel at a time. Trains do slightly prefer empty normal tracks over tunnels, but will use a tunnel over congested track.
- Trains using a tunnel have their speed and traversal time estimated. This means a train using a tunnel won't be exactly the same speed as a train on a regular track, but they are approximately equivalent in their total journey time.
- If a train is using a tunnel and its forward path is removed due to rail network or station changes, once it has left the underground section it can look for a reverse path back through the tunnel. If it can't find a route it will pull to the front of the tunnel's exit portal ready for a path becoming available in the future.
- Manually driven trains can not use a tunnel. They will be stopped at the tunnel portal entrance track or from entering the underground part of the tunnel.
- Trains that aren't following an automatic schedule will be prevented from entering the tunnel portal's tracks or going underground. Tunnels are reserved for intentional train traffic and not free wheeling trains.
- Destroyed tunnels will lose the train and players within.
- If 2 trains try to enter a tunnel at once one will be rejected and a GUI alert raised.
- Trains with players riding in them use a more detailed tunnel traversal logic than non-player trains to give the player a smoother riding experience. This will mean that they take a different amout of time to use a tunnel as its speed is more actively managed. This is only done for trains with players riding in them as its less UPS effecient and is approximately the same final result.


Known Limitations
=================

There are certain limitations of the mod which have been chosen over alternatives. The reasons for these choices can include keeping the mod as light UPS wise as possible, to avoid overly complicated code logic for non standard (edge) use cases or just due to limitations in Factorio and how a mod can interact with it.

- When a tunnel is being used bi-directionally (2 ways) and 2 trains simultaneously approach from opposite ends in the specific situation of; an unused tunnel, with clear approaching track, both trains at slow speeds; In some cases they can both be allowed to reserve a path into the tunnel. When they both reach the portal they will be mutually blocking each other from using the tunnel, leaving the rails deadlocked. At present the 2 trains are stopped and a GUI alert is raised for both trains to the player to manually resolve as it should be a very rare occurrence. This is not an issue when the tunnel is being used in a single direction rail line, as is the mod's primary expected use case.
- Trains kill counts will be lost when using a tunnel as the Factorio API doesn't allow this to be set by a mod. It will also be artificially inflated by 1 when a train leaves the tunnel. Factorio API request: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=99049
- Trains leaving a portal very fast which plan to do a non stop loop straight back into the same tunnel portal will instead leave very slowly. This is to protect against a leaving train that hasn't already reserved its own tunnel again, as this is an unsupported usage case and shouldn't ever exist in a real rail network.


Mod Compatibility
=================

At present the mod isn't tested or supported with any mods that add custom train carriages or interferes with the rail tunnel entities in any way.
Notes on generic mod compatibility:
    - Any mod that moves or removes entities from the map without raising notification events is not supported.

Blacklisted mods:
    - Picker Dollies - lets the player move entities randomly and life is too short to try and undo all the damage it could do.


Editor Mode
===========

- Don't mine any part of a tunnel while in Editor mode in the Entity tab. As this just removes the tunnel part without notifying the mod. If you are in any other tab (i.e. Time) then this is fine as Factorio notifies the mod. In this case I'd advise loading a save from before this corrupted state was reached.


Debug Mode
==========

In debug mode some additional state checking will be done and hard errors thrown in some undesirable state situations. Does have a small UPS impact and is turned off by default.
Debug mode can be enabled/disabled via the command "railway_tunnel_toggle_debug_state" and it will report the new state in text upon changing.


Mod Design History
==================

This is technically the second major iteration of this mod. Below is a brief history of this for those curious.
    - The first iteration was developed to beta stage from December 2020 for around 6 months, before being abandoned. Its vision was to mirror base Factorio's train activities while providing the most convenient player experience. This included supporting any length trains moving through a set tunnel portal size. This led to ever growing logic complexity as more use cases and edge cases were discovered. This logic bloat required growing state data and manipulation to be done which led to the mods UPS usage growing steadily. Collective this ground development to a halt in addition to other commitments.
    - In December 2021 I reviewed the mod to decide its future. To resolve both the logic complexity and high UPS impact of iteration 1 the mod was rescoped to the vision of providing automatic train usage through a tunnel with minimal UPS usage in a simple code manner. This rescope led to massive changes throughout the mods logic and some reduction on user experience. A simple example is the move to require a train to be fully within a portal's length to be able to use a tunnel, thus requiring the player to fit in much larger tunnels in their designs. In a megabase scenario this shouldn't be an issue, but to small bases it may be an inconvenience.
So far iteration 2 of the mod has succeeded in its aim of reducing UPS usage and while it introduces some player inconveniences it also opens up future opportunities, i.e. curved tunnel and portal parts.
