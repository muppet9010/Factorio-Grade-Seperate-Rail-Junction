Terminology
-----------

A tunnel is the connection between 2 portals and can be used in either direction.
Each portal has an Entry part where the trains enter, a Transition point where the trains are teleported away and beyond this a Blocked area where the tracks are permanently blocked.
A managed train is a train using a tunnel. The managed train has a direction of travel through the tunnel and thus an Entrance portal and Exit portal.



Variable Naming
---------------

A variable that references a LuaObject's field is named as: objectName_fieldName   i.e.  approachingTrain_speed



EmmyLua Class Definitions
------------------------

- Fields that are only populated when a certain state of the parent is obtained are separated out together with a "---" line above them. i.e. the constant fields of a portal part, vs its portal membership requiring ones, vs its tunnel requiring ones. Purely to improve class readability at the head of the document, no impact on intellisense.
- Some large classes have their fields grouped based on functional role only with a "---" line. Purely to improve class readability at the head of the document, no impact on intellisense.



EmmyLua nil, null and ? for optional things.
--------------------------------------------

- All uses of optional arguments//params/returns/etc should have "?" appended to the end of the name and have "|null" on the end of their field types.
- While technically some scenarios can support "nil" it's easier to do the same everywhere.
- "nil" doesn't work for anything other than function returns, so I added "null" as a placeholder.
- Aliases don't support ?, so can only have "null" set as one of the types.
