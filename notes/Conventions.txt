Terminology
-----------

A tunnel is the connection between 2 portals and can be used in either direction.
Each portal has an Entry part where the trains enter, a Transition point where the trains are teleported away and beyond this a Blocked area where the tracks are permanently blocked.
A managed train is a train using a tunnel. The managed train has a direction of travel through the tunnel and thus an Entrance portal and Exit portal.



Variable Naming
---------------

A variable that references a LuaObject's field is named as: objectName_fieldName   i.e.  approachingTrain_speed



EmmyLua Class Definitions
------------------------

- Fields that are only populated when a certain state of the parent is obtained are separated out together with a "---" line above them. i.e. the constant fields of a portal part, vs its portal membership requiring ones, vs its tunnel requiring ones. Purely to improve class readability at the head of the document, no impact on intellisense.
- Some large classes have their fields grouped based on functional role only with a "---" line. Purely to improve class readability at the head of the document, no impact on intellisense.
