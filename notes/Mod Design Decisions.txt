Underground segments building, mining and fast replacing
--------------------------------------------------------
The difficult variation here is supporting the fast replacing and the variation between player and robot events triggered.

Player:
    Place ghost on empty space: on_pre_build > on_built_entity
    Place ghost fast replace over entity: on_pre_build
    Place ghost fast replace over ghost: on_pre_build > on_built_entity
    Build entity: on_pre_build > on_built_entity
    Mine entity: on_pre_player_mined_item
    Fast Replace entity: on_pre_build > on_pre_player_mined_item > on_built_entity

Construction bot:
    Bot build entity: on_robot_built_entity
    Bot mine entity: on_robot_pre_mined
    Bot fast replace entity: on_built_entity


Ghost placement of fast replacement and rotations
-------------------------------------------------

A player can fast replace an entity over itself with a different rotation if it supports fast replacement; But a ghost placed over an entity using fast replacement with a different rotation is set back to the original rotation.
