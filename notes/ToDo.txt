Support 2 tunnels crossing
--------------------------

    - Option A - EXPLORED IN THIS COMMIT: Have a 6x6 tunnel segment that is for 2 tunnels crossing each other. Will need changes to tunnel complete checking logic. This can NOT fast replace existing segments in a line as the neighbour segments block the center segment from being replaced. On the player holding it and selecting a valid target the piece in hand changes to a 2x2 and it will fast replace. Issues around ends of tunnels overlapping, logisitic requests and inventory filters of me changing item stacks. Maybe returning the held item to the inventory and giving a tempory item to the cursor is a better answer, then syncing up counts.

    - Option B: Should be just able to build tunnel segments against one another and this is a handled configuration (needs solid across tunnel (3 pieces wide/long). Would need to include the crossing tunnel bits in both tunnels segments once placed, to prevent the user from removing a required segment from the other direction's tunnel. Could auto place missing crossing segments if in inventory and if not show message. Avoids any special crossing pieces being needed or placed. Would need to suppport crossing N tunnels sequentially.

    - Option C: use only 2x6 pieces, but have a special 2x6 that is for underground crossing underground. It can be fast replaced with other 2x6 tunnel pieces. It must either force: have 3 pieces placed the full width of the tunnel, or be 1 piece wide and have 2 normal tunnel pieces each side to make the crossing tunnel valid. So is the same as Option B, but requires special underground crossing underground pieces, rather than just butting 2 tunnels up against one another. Would need to suppport crossing N tunnels sequentially.



NOTES
-----

    - We can't have a 2x2 tunnel segment as diagonal rail over lapping the hidden signals (now not part of the segment collision box) breaks them and means adjoining above crossing tracks are now 1 rail segment.
