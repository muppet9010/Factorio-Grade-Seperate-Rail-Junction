Mod Aim:
Be as light weight UPS wise for running trains through tunnels as possible. Sacrafice everything to achive this and if odd scenarios arise provide a manual fix that doesn't burden UPS.

Major:
	- require a portal area the length of the train for entry and exit. So only when the entering train is fully within this area (signal block) does the train get committed and cloned to outbound portal area with 0 speed. Work out how long the train would take to navigate to the end of the exit portal area and then after that time set the train active and its speed either full or 0.
	- Any train trying to enter the portal area that is longer than it will be hard blocked at the border, set to manual and a notificaiton to user shown.
	- Clickable on portal area's will raise a dialogue showing max supported train length for this and the other end (if exists). This are will have some above ground visual blocking graphics so train within it isn't visible.
	- Allows corners and diagonals with the tunnel pieces as its just an abstract length to have traversal time calculated for now.

Minor:
	- place the dummy train on each end rather than having to update the portal area signals every tick when no train is there.
	- set the incoming trains speed every x ticks. won't be perfect, but should keep roughly the right speed ?
	- manually driven trains trying to enter a portal area will either be stopped dead if tunnel in use or can be manually driven through using same logic as was being worked on for full mod version. If problematic just make it go on auto once committed and thne at the far end return it to the players control from 0 speed.
	- as train will be removed and added in 1 go the code to handle this should be much simplier.
	- very light monitoring code should be required.
	- TrainLeftTunnelOngoing will need to stay roughly the same as we still need to know when the tunnels in-use vs free.
	- Train leaving monitoring shouldn't be needed as we will just check for time & speed when train is ready to leave the tunnel portal area. This will then become TrainLeftTunnelOngoing.
	- Expect no need for per tick activity and things can be scheduled tick or per event driven.
	- no need to handle a train being in multiple tunnels at once as this won't be physically possible.
	- add an option to have the tunnel train mined to a chest in the tunnel itself should some weird issue arise where the trian can't be gotten out. This is like a manual last resort.
	- no need to handle a train losing carriages while its using a tunnel. As this won't be possible given its direct teleportation now. Make wagons invunerable until they start to move when leaving.
