Vision
----------------
    Be as light weight UPS wise for running trains through tunnels as possible. Sacrafice everything to achive this and if odd scenarios arise provide a manual fix that doesn't burden UPS.
    Expected behavour:
        - When a train is traversing (underground) we initally assume it has a path onwards on the far side when calculating time. At arrival time check if it can path at speed and if not then work out how long it would have taken to traverse and stop at the exit portal entry signal. Then reschedule its arrival time and speed to this. So a train either leaves a tunnel at full(ish) speed with an onwards path or at a slower speed for the path it can get at that moment. This should only require a few pathing and arrival time delays while keeping the end result pretty much realistic.
        - If 2 trains both try and use the tunnel at once stop the second train at the border, set it to manual and fire a GUI alert. Don't let manaul/coasting trains enter the portal area as this just avoids needing to handle collisions. We want to add cheap issue detection mechanics, but nothing UPS costly.
        - Portal Redesign:
            - There will be 2 portal parts initially.
                - Portal End - a 6x6 tile piece that has to be used at both ends of each portal. At the End part it will provide 6 of the 8 tiles needed for the detector entity, end signals, blocker locomotive and Blocked end invisible signals. At the Entry part it will provide 6 tiles: 2 tiles needed for the entry signals and detector, 2 tiles for the End part and 2 tiles for a leaving train to pull forward in when leaving.
                - Portal Segment - a 2x6 piece that is used to build up the portal's straight length. This will make up the full train length, but no padding needed as the entry part handles this.
            - Will have the example composition of: E S S E U U U U E S S E
            - Now we are using an End portal detector entity its death triggers before the train tries to complete moving in to the blocker loco. Meaning no end padding space is needed for fast trains.
        - Initially tunnels (portals and underground) must be built in straight lines.
        - Any train trying to enter the portal area that is longer than the potral area it will be hard blocked at the border, set to manual and a notificaiton to user shown.
        - A train that is on the portal tracks or is approaching the transition signal is free to turn around. Its only committed to use the tunnel once it reaches the end of the entrance portal tracks and triggered the transition train detector.
