[item-description]
railway_tunnel-portal_end=Must place a Tunnel portal end on both ends of a portal for a tunnel, so regular track side and underground tunnel segment side.
railway_tunnel-portal_segment-straight=A segment of tunnel portal that trains enter to use the tunnel. A line of portal segments must have a portal end piece on both tips.
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-straight=A segment of underground tunnel that can be walked/driven over. Can connect to any other straight segment or a straight end of other segments (curves).
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-straight-rail_crossing=A segment of underground tunnel with surface rails crossing it.
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-straight-tunnel_crossing=A segment of underground tunnel with another tunnel crossing it perpendicular. These must be built with 3 sequentially in the main direction (green arrow) for the crossing tunnel (yellow arrow) to be complete.
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-curved=A curved segment of underground tunnel. Can be flipped (__CONTROL__flip-blueprint-horizontal__) to get the other 4 rotations just like a blueprint of curved rail. The diagonal end of this part can be either connected to a diagonal or corner segment, but not the diagonal end of another curved segment. The straight end can connect to other straight ended segments.
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-curved-flipped=SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN BY PLAYER - flipped copy of "Underground segment - curved".
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-diagonal=A diagonal segment of underground tunnel. Can be flipped (__CONTROL__flip-blueprint-horizontal__) to get the other 2 rotations just like a blueprint of curved rail. Can be connected to corner and diagonal segments, plus the diagonal end of curved segments.
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-diagonal-flipped=SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN BY PLAYER - flipped copy of "Underground segment - diagonal".
railway_tunnel-underground_segment-corner=A corner segment of underground tunnel. Intended to make 90 degree corners by connecting curved or diagonal segments togeather. Can also connect to other corners as an alternative diagonal track design.
